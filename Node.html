    <p><strong>Node.js</strong> is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Built on Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables server-side scripting, meaning developers can use JavaScript to write backend code for building scalable and high-performance web applications. It is especially well-suited for handling asynchronous, event-driven operations, making it ideal for applications that require real-time communication, such as chat apps, streaming services, and APIs.

        One of the key features of Node.js is its non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for one task to complete before starting another. This contributes to its speed and efficiency. Node.js also comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools that simplify and accelerate development.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p><strong>Node.js Architecture</strong> is based on a single-threaded, event-driven model that is designed to handle asynchronous I/O operations, making it highly efficient and scalable, especially for applications that involve a large number of simultaneous connections, like web servers or real-time apps.</p>
