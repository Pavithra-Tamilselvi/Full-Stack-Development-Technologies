    <p><strong>Django</strong> is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the <abbr title="Model-View-Template"><b>MVT</b></abbr> architectural pattern and emphasizes the principle of <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself"><b>DRT</b></abbr> to promote code reusability and clean design. Django comes with a wide range of built-in features such as an admin interface, authentication system, URL routing, and form handling, which help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently. Known for its scalability, flexibility, and strong community support, Django is used to develop everything from simple websites to complex, data-driven web applications.</p>
