    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a versatile and widely used programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It works alongside <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> to create engaging user experiences by enabling features like form validation, animations, dropdown menus, real-time updates, and more. JavaScript runs directly in the web browser, allowing web pages to respond to user actions without needing to reload the entire page. It is also used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js, making it a full-stack development language. With its simple syntax and powerful capabilities, JavaScript is essential for building modern web applications and is supported by a large ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks such as <b>React, Angular, and Vue.js.</b></p>
