    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a widely used programming language known for its simplicity, portability, and reliability. It follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere," meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is object-oriented, which helps developers build modular and reusable code for large-scale applications. It is commonly used in web development, desktop applications, mobile apps (especially Android), and enterprise software systems. With built-in features like automatic memory management, exception handling, and strong security, Java continues to be a popular and trusted language in the software development industry.</p>
