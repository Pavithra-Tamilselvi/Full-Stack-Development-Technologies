    <p><strong>Spring</strong> is a powerful, open-source framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure that simplifies the development of robust and scalable applications by promoting good practices such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and modular architecture. At the core of the Spring framework is the Inversion of Control (IoC) container, which manages the lifecycle and dependencies of objects, making code more flexible and easier to maintain. Spring also includes several modules for tasks like web development (Spring MVC), database access (Spring JDBC and Spring Data), security (Spring Security), and more. Its lightweight and loosely coupled design make it a popular choice for developers creating everything from simple web applications to complex, distributed systems.</p>
