    <p><abbr title="Structured Query Language"><b>SQL</b></abbr> is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data within a database. SQL is the foundation of many database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. It consists of several types of commands, including Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating and modifying database structures, Data Manipulation Language (DML) for handling data operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, and Data Query Language (DQL) for retrieving data using the SELECT statement. SQL is widely used across industries due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to handle large volumes of structured data, making it an essential tool for database administrators, developers, and data analysts.</p>
